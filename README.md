# Drawing Classifier App

Overview
This Python application allows users to draw shapes and classify them using machine learning models. It features a GUI for drawing and buttons for managing the drawing process, model training, and prediction.

## Features
- Draw directly onto a canvas using the mouse.
- Save drawings into predefined classes for training.
- Train machine learning models on user-generated drawings.
- Predict the class of new drawings.
- Save and load trained models.
- Change between different machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Tkinter**: GUI library.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Image handling library.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Advanced image processing.
- **NumPy**: Handling data arrays.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms.

## Setup
To run this application, you will need Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python pillow scikit-learn
